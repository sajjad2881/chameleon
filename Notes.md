# Notes for Myself 

1. Make the prompts more clear and make sure they are consistent in being passed.
2. Make sure the names for the models are being declared in only one place (e.g. alice, bob, charlie, david, eve) and can easily be changed.
3. Make sure its easy and give instruction to add more models or swap out models. 
4. Make sure the cards are of high quality.
5. Make sure the player order is random, and first player gets shifted each round.
6. Add so that every N rounds or som there is a new player order.
